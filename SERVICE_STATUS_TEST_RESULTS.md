# Service Status Checker - Debug Fix Summary

## ✅ Issue Fixed Successfully

**Original Error:**
```
🚨 Critical error in service status checker: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'checkAllServices')
```

**Root Cause:**
The issue was caused by incorrect method binding when exporting the static method. When you assign a method reference like `ServiceStatusChecker.logServiceStatus`, it loses its `this` context in JavaScript.

**Solution Applied:**
Changed the export from:
```typescript
// ❌ Incorrect - loses context
export const checkServicesOnLoad = ServiceStatusChecker.logServiceStatus;
```

To:
```typescript
// ✅ Correct - preserves context
export const checkServicesOnLoad = () => ServiceStatusChecker.logServiceStatus();
```

- ✅ `/api/ping` - Working (returns: `{"message":"ping"}`)
